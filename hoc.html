	<p class="description">We welcome new students here at Booth every day. Our Warrior Blazers team helps the counselors tour the students and make them feel more comfortable with their surroundings. However, we noticed that they could use some help with the technology part of the tour. So, we stepped in. We first went to the counselor's office to take notes of what they needed from us. Then, we presented the ideas to the rest of the SLED group and took notes of any improvements they thought could be made. After that, we designed a technology guide to print and give to the new students. Next, we had some new students try it out and see how it went. The students were very pleased with the guidance, and we now do the technology tour during 5th period every day.</p>
